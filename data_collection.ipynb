    "We created the Twitter dataset in the duration of this project, which meant that a number of the cleaning steps were carried out in the creation of the dataset. Since we chose to answer our data science question by selecting eight bills that were voted on in the 116th Congress, we filtered each representative’s Twitter history by only selecting Tweets that discerned one of the eight bills.  This was executed by checking whether or not the Tweet contained key words from the bill or a particular hashtag, demonstrating support for or against the bill. The last step taken in cleaning this data was the removal of any non-English words in the Tweet, which was due to the Tweepy library failing to remove all HTML code in the text part of the tweet. Python’s string function: isalpha() was used to remove these invalid parts of the Tweet text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the eight GovTrack CSV files, which contained the votes on all eight bills, the cleaning stage of this dataset involved dropping all rows of congress people who were not selected for analysis. After this first step was taken, the eight CSV files were then merged into a single CSV file, where each row contained a representative and a column corresponding to their party, state, and their votes on the eight bills.  In this step, concern was raised on whether these cleaning steps were properly done since many representatives did not vote on any of the bills. After careful inspection, it was deducted that many representatives were not voting on any of these bills, which is particularly interesting since the congress people were selected by how active and popular they are on Twitter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With these two datasets cleaned, the next step involved pre-processing the tweets into a numerical representation so that they can be directly compared to their voting pattern, which took on a value of ‘Yay, ‘Nay’, or ‘NA’ (no vote).  In order to categorize the tweets into the main two categories, we had to take a hybrid approach on how the text sentiment was conducted.  Detailed in the bill_sentiment() block of code (which was the function responsible for the text sentiment analysis), each bill contained key words or hashtags that inarguably reveals that politician’s sentiment  on the bill e.g. #trumpswall, which shows clear support for the bill of condemning Trump’s National Emergency to fund building the Mexican-American wall and the hashtag: #illegalimmigration, which supports Trump’s National Emergency, indicating a vote against the bill.  After this initial analysis, further sentiment analysis was carried out by utilizing Google’s Natural Language Processing Text Sentiment Analysis Cloud Tool to categorize the data. This step was particularly difficult to do since the NLP tool could only estimate the positivity and negativity of a tweet and since many congressmen’s tweets on Twitter are of a condescending tone, discerning their view on the topic was beyond the scope of analysis that could be done.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This was a critical limitation on our project because deducing the sentiment in regards to whether or not they approve or disapprove of a bill is a Natural Language Processing Task that leading Deep Learning Researchers are conducting their research on.  Despite this, the Google NLP tool was still used to get the sentiment score, a number between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive) and depending on the bill, this number was multiplied by -1 to capture whether the congress person would vote for or against a bill (this was done to standardize the sentiment and align the sentiment score with the predicted vote on a bill). After this step, the list of tweet texts, pertaining to each bill, became a list of sentiment scores, which was then averaged into a single number.  Finally, this score was converted into a 1 if it fell in the range [0.1, 1.0] to indicate support for the bill, a 0 if the score fell in the range [-0.1, 0.1] for a NA (no vote), or -1 if it fell between [-1.0, -0.1], as a vote against the bill.  After these cleaning steps, the dataset was set up to do a simple comparison between their predicted Tweet sentiment score and their recorded vote."

    "In order to web scrape Twitter for the tweet history of each congressman/woman, a Twitter Developer Account had to be requested from the company. Once this step was completed, we had the permission to collect all the Twitter data we needed to formulate the dataset. As for the GovTrack datasets, the CSV files, containing the votes on a bill from each House of Representatives, are public records (since the transparency of representatives voting record is vital for maintaining a representative democracy) no permission was needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of privacy, this was not an issue for the GovTrack files since the CSV files are online and downloadable with no usage restrictions.  As for using the Twitter API and the tweepy library, there was a restriction on the number of page requests that could be made in an hourly basis. Thus, curating the dataset required the sleep function to be used to stay within Twitter’s allowance of web scraping.\n",

    "Working on this type of problem involved various challenges in terms of answering our data science question without bias. To best represent the population we are studying, the following steps were completed: an even number of representatives were selected from both the Democratic and Republican party; a systematic way of selecting which of the 435 politicians from the House of Representatives to use for analysis was specified (those with the most tweets and followers).  As for selecting which of the bills voted on in the House were used for analysis: the bills that had the most divide were used i.e. there was a near even split of votes.  This method of selecting bills was advantageous since it avoided biasedly selecting bills introduced to the house disproportionately by one party.  However, there was a significant issue in terms of how to filter the Tweet data.  The list of key words belonging to each bill were accumulated by taking key words in each of the bill statements and from analyzing the most popular results from searching each of the bills on Twitter. Whether or not Twitter has algorithm bias in their search results was out of the project’s scope of control; however, selecting the hashtags from these search results left room for human bias to unintendedly select a biased list of words and hashtags.  This was a challenge to the project since the poor execution of the step would skew the data set by disproportionately containing tweets predominantly from one side of the vote. However, since this was an issue raised before curating this list of key words, emphasis was places on analyzing tweets from both parties. "
